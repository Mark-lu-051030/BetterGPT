## Architecture

BetterGPT follows SOLID principles and Clean Architecture, ensuring maintainability and scalability. The project is structured into several packages:

- `app`: Contains the main entry point of the application.
- `data_access`: Handles data operations such as database interactions.
- `entity`: Defines core business entities.
- `interface_adapter`: Manages user interface controllers and adapters.
- `use_case`: Contains the business logic of the application.
- `view`: Manages the graphical user interface components.

## Entities

### User (Phase 1)
Represents a user in the system. Contains attributes like username, password, email, and subscription details.

### Subscription (Phase 1)
Represents a subscription plan for a user. Contains attributes like subscription type, start date, end date, and usage limits.
